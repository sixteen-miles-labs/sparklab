"""Per-quant-format expert bank providers for the offload MoE cache.

A provider owns everything between "checkpoint on disk" and "banks ready for
``OffloadMoeCache.set_bank_sources``" for one ``expert_quant`` value: loading the
pinned host banks, picking a kernel backend, repacking into its layout, and
extracting the GPU-resident alphas if the format folds its global scales. The
engine stays quant-agnostic: it calls :func:`load_expert_banks` and wires the
returned bundle into the cache.

A format is fully described by three per-format tables: ``_BANK_SCHEMAS``
(offload_cache, bank layout), ``_PROVIDERS`` (here, loading/repack), and
``OffloadMoELayer._expert_gemm`` (kernel dispatch). Adding a format touches those
three places and nothing else.
