"""Reusable pinned host-bank primitives shared by the fast expert-load paths.

Two ideas the parallel read of the original checkpoint and FTW (read a repacked
contiguous cache) paths both rely on:

* **pin-after-fill** -- allocate the bank as a *lazy* anonymous ``mmap`` (no pages
  resident, instant), fill it with real data, and only THEN ``cudaHostRegister`` it.
  Registering already-resident pages just page-locks them; registering a lazy mmap first
  faults+zero-fills every page (~137 GiB -> ~47 s for DSV4) and that zero-fill is then
  immediately overwritten by the read. So pin-after-fill removes a whole redundant pass.
* **chunked multi-threaded O_DIRECT** -- DMA straight from disk into the (page-aligned)
  bank, bypassing the page cache, with many concurrent ``preadv`` on one fd (scales to the
  device's queue-depth ceiling even for a single file).

The mmaps are held for the process lifetime (the banks live as long as the offload cache).
